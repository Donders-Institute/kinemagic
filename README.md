# Kinemagic - analysis toolbox for motion data

The kinemagic product is a set of tools (primarily, but not exclusively,
matlab m-files) for processing motion data. It extracts, processes, analyses,
and reports on kinematic parameters and spatio-temporal dynamics of motion data.

Further information can be found [here][website].

See core/dependencies.txt for a summary list of dependencies on matlab toolboxes
and a complete list of inter-dependencies of matlab m-files.
